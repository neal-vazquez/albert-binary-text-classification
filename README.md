# ALBERT Binary Text Classification for Movie Reviews

## Overview
This Python script is designed to perform binary text classification using the ALBERT model. The aim is to categorize movie reviews as either positive or negative based on the text content.

## Libraries Used
### Data Manipulation and Calculation
1. **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
2. **NumPy**: Employed for numerical computations, especially during data preprocessing and model evaluation.

### Visualization
1. **Matplotlib**: Used for basic data visualization, such as plotting graphs and charts.
2. **Seaborn**: Utilized for more advanced statistical graphics and data visualizations.

### Deep Learning
1. **PyTorch**: The primary library for tensor computations and building the ALBERT model.
    - **torch.nn**: A sub-library containing modules and extensible classes for building neural networks.

## Script Structure
1. **Import Libraries**: Import all the necessary Python libraries.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the movie reviews dataset.
3. **Model Architecture**: Set up the ALBERT model for text classification.
4. **Training and Evaluation**: Train the model on the dataset and evaluate its performance.

## How to Run
1. Ensure all the required libraries are installed.
2. Place the dataset in the correct directory.
3. Run the script.
